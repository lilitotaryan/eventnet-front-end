    description: `Is there anything Andy Thomson won’t try on his farm? 
            “I won’t do anything illegal,” he jokes. 
            This armer loves to experiment with new businesses and crops. Beyond his core crops – soybeans, corn, and wheat – he runs a sawdust business, grows  high-oleic soybeans and non-GMO corn.
            “We are always looking for opportunities, but it’s not always about the money,” says Thomson. “It’s about the challenge and being able to make something new work. That, to me, is just as satisfying as making money.”
            While Andy’s success is tied to his willingness to seek out and try new ventures, it’s also because he isn’t afraid of failing. “I’m lucky to be financially stable enough to experiment and realize that sometimes we will fail,” says the 57-year-old farmer. “Just because you fail once, doesn’t mean you have to quit.”
            \n LESSONS LEARNED GROWING NON-GMO CORN \n
            In 2017, while most farmers were selling corn for $3 a bushel, Thomson sold a portion of his corn crop for $4.50. The secret? The corn was non-GMO grown for a specialty grocery store. 
            The grocery store contracts with growers, like Thomson, to control the quality of grain used in their products. Andy began growing for the store in 2015, even though his first attempt at non-GMO was not successful.
            “If you’re going to try something like that, don’t be afraid of failure. Try to learn something from it,” says Andy.
            As more companies commit to non-GMO, Thomson’s customer base has expanded to include poultries and dairies. Yields are comparable to his GMO corn, which yields 170 bushels per acre on average.
            While the non-GMO vs. GMO debate can be a bit contentious, Beam says he views the issue as “strictly a business decision. If someone wants to pay extra for me to go to the hassle of growing non-GMO corn, then God bless them.”

    title: "ARE INSECTS THE NEW LIVESTOCK?",

    description: `Although Thomas Shelby grew up on a row-crop farm, his passion for basketball led him to Ireland after college. After four and a half years coaching and working as an investment banker in Dublin, it was time for a change.
            The family farm back home was ready for transition, too. Even though he spent more time on the basketball court than working on the farm as a kid, he decided, “Well, I’ll give farming a try.”
            In September 2017, Shelby handed in his resignation at the bank and returned home. The night he got off the plane, Shelby learned to drive a tractor. Throughout the remainder of the harvest season, he ran the grain cart. “I am fairly certain I spilled corn in every field we were in, but it all worked out,” he laughs.
            After the season wrapped up, Thomas made time to talk and strategize with his father. He recalls him saying, “If you don’t want to fight the whole corn and soybean thing like I have for the last 30-plus years and want to come up with a niche, go for it. We’ll help you get started.”
            \n A GROWING NICHE \n
           As an avid podcast listener, Shelby heard about entomophagy, the human use of insects as food, in several episodes of his favorite shows. According to Global Market Insights, the edible insect market was worth $55 million and growing in 2017, and is still growing dramatically.
           “Crickets are 60% protein by dry weight,” notes Thomas. He says the insects are also a good source of iron, calcium, and vitamin B12. They have nine essential amino acids, as well.
           After doing his research, on January 1, 2018, Shelby sent his parents an article. He had discovered a niche he was interested in.
           “What about crickets?” he asked her parents. “They both kind of looked at me and said, ‘What about crickets?’ ” he recalls with a laugh. 
           \n A LEAP INTO CRICKET FARMING \n
            Ten days later, Shelby ordered her first 10,000 crickets. He cut a hole in the lid and added a screen to allow fresh air in the container. Then, he placed egg cartons in each tote to offer the crickets a place to hide.
            Crickets can eat vegetable scraps, but Shelby has found that feeding his insects chicken feed works best. “Because it’s a dry substrate, I don’t have as much of a mold problem,” he explains.
            He also ensures each tote has a water source. Because young crickets are so tiny they can drown in a single drop of water, a wet sponge provides adequate water for the crickets as they grow.
            After overcoming a few mishaps along the learning curve, he has built the population to a stable 250,000. It’s his goal to grow the population to 20 million. Someday, he hopes to partner with other cricket farmers to have the volume of crickets necessary for mass production of the protein bars and dry roasted crickets she sells today.

    title: "ADOPTING PRECISION AG-TECH TODAY",

    description: `When Linda Blake suddenly found herself leading the family’s farm three years ago, she was faced with some pretty difficult decisions.
            “My husband, David, and I purchased our 500-acre farm more than 25 years ago and built it from the ground up,” Blake says.
            Through the years, it has evolved into a diversified operation. The Blakes grow corn, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa, and raise a variety of livestock. 
            “We were living our dream,” she says. “When he passed away, I had to decide what I was going to do with the farm.”
            “Whether we were riding on the tractor or checking fields, every single day was about agriculture,” recalls Linsey.
            \n 1. ONTRAC 3 ASSISTED STEERING \n
            Although Linda had never owned an automated or assisted steering system, she was open to technology that would better guide machines through the field.  
            “With this system, I can also save time, fuel, and possibly other input costs by eliminating gaps and overlaps.”
            Since this device easily transfers between machines, Blake can use assisted steering in both the planting tractor and the combine at harvest time.
            \n 2. PLANTER CLUTCHES AND SEED MONITORING \n
            While Blake says the SureStop electric clutches and Advanced Seed Monitoring may not be the newest pieces of technology, they still have a big impact on planting. 
            “With SureStop, Linda can shut off rows as she comes into an area that has already been applied, which saves time and seed,” explains Watson. “It also increases yield potential by eliminating point rows and overapplication in headland passes.”
            With Advanced Seed Monitoring, she is better able to manage planter performance. “Now that she can see singulation and spacing, adjustments can be made to the row meter.”
            \n 3. GPS 6500 \n
            The GPS 6500 was chosen for its reliability and the consistent number of satellites it pulls in. It is also unlocked for GLONASS, which allows the receiver to utilize the signal from Russian satellites.  
            “On average, we see 14-plus satellites with the GPS 6500,” Blake explains. “This receiver will really help with uptime and consistency of maintaining a signal in the hilly terrain and wooded areas of the farm.”
            \n A PROGRESSIVE OPERATION \n
            By adopting new precision  tools, Blake is not only meeting the specific needs of her farm today, but also building a progressive operation for the future. “I want to pass that legacy on to our children,” she says.
            “The next generation coming into agriculture is going to be dependent on technology,” says Linda. “The more we can get them interested in agriculture and invested in the farm, the better we continue the legacy of the small family farm and strengthen the future.”
